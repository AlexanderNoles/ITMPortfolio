                        <span class="highlightText">my main project during my gap year</span>
                        and largest, completed project to date. It is a 
                        <span class="highlightText">fully released video game</span>
                        (Steam and Itch.io) made entirely by me, including all art and music.
                        In total it took around 
                        <span class="highlightText">8-9 months</span>
                        from start to finish, however, my work on it was inconsistent and personally I estimate it should have taken only about 4 or 5.

                    <h2 style="text-align: left;">
                        I wouldn't consider the game a failure, however, if I made it again 
                        <span class="highlightText">I would probably change ~80% of the final version</span>. 
                        There is a demo on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1951910/Dash_And_Slash/">steam page</a>
                        if you want to try it out.

                        "Mart-E-Mart" is my 
                        <span class="highlightText">current project</span>,
                        I am the programmer on the project and am working alongside an artist friend of mine.
                        There is a chance we'll recruit more people in the future but for now it is just us.
                        Development hasn't been going on for long (and has been side-tracked by both of us going to uni)
                        but we already have a strong idea of what we want in the final version. The art style of the game
                        could be likened to 
                        <span class="highlightText">"Paper-Mario"</span>, 
                        though the gameplay is based around a convenience store.

                        So far, the 
                        <span class="highlightText">majority of my work has gone towards making general code</span>
                        (a performant pathfinding implementation, a replacement  for Unity's default console, etc.)
                        that can be carried forward.
                        We're currently expecting it to be 
                        <span class="highlightText">done sometime in 2023</span>.

                        My first released game was made with two friends and it was called 
                        <span class="highlightText">Skelli-Boy</span>. 
                        Unfortunately, it has been taken down since. It was released in late 2020.

                        I have also participated in around 10 game jams (typically short, game making competitions), 
                        the code for those projects is always open-source and can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderNoles">GitHub</a>.
                        The above image is from my submission to Mini-Jam 111.
